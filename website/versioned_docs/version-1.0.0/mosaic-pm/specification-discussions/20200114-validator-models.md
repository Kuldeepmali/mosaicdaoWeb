## Overview

## User stories

1. As a validator, I should be able to subscribe to the following entities from the graph node (origin chain).
   - CreatedMetachain(s) -> metachainid, anchor, core, consensus gateway
   - UpdatedMetachainState(s) -> metachainid, lifetime status.
   - JoinedValidator(s)-> metachainId, core, validator address, begin height, end height, reputation, staked ETH/MOST
   - UpdatedValidatorStatus(es)-> validator address, status
   - UpdatedReputation(s) -> validator address, reputation,
   - UpdatedCoreStatus(es) -> metachainId, core, status.
   - AnchoredStateRoot(s) -> metachainId, anchor, blocknumber, stateroot
   - DeclaredOpenKernel(s) -> < TBD >
   - ProposedMetablock(s) -> < TBD >
   - RegisteredVote(s) -> < TBD >
   - PrecommittedMetablock(s) -> < TBD >

   - CommitteeDecision(s) -> < TBD >
   - CommittedMetablock(s) -> < TBD >
2. As a validator, I should be able to subscribe to the following entities from the graph node (auxiliary chain).

   - < TBD >

3. As a validator, I should be able to re-subscribe to the graph node if the subscription breaks.

4. As a user, I should be able to deposit OST/MOST in the consensus gateway contract on origin chain, so that I can mint utMOST on the auxiliary chain.

5. As a validator, I should be able to stake OST/MOST and WETH tokens while joining the metachain/core.

6. As a validator, I should be able to join the metachain/core before the core moves to the open status, and deposit OST/MOST.

7. As a validator, I should be able to join the metachain/core when the core is open or precommitted.

8. As a validator, I should be notified when the minimum number of validators joins the metachain/core, so that I can create the genesis file and start the auxiliary chain node. (wait N ethereum blocks)

9. As a facilitator, I should be notified when the message for the opening of the new kernel is declared in the consensus gateway contract on the origin chain. (just store the declared message)

10. As a validator, I should be able to observe the blocks generated on the origin chain so that I can report the origin chain links in the OriginProtocore contract on the auxiliary chain, every epoch length. (source must be justified)

11. As a validator, I should be able to observe the blocks generated in the auxiliary chain so that I can report the auxiliary chain links in the SelfProtocore contract on the auxiliary chain, every epoch length. (source must be justified)

12. As a validator, I should be notified when the gas consumed in the auxiliary chain will reach the gas accumulation target, so that I can propose a new metablock in the core contract on the origin chain. (for now keep this logic simple, like every dynasty mod m)

13. As a validator, I should be notified when the target checkpoint of a link on the OriginProtocore is justified/finalized.

14. As a validator, I should be notified when the target checkpoint of a link on SelfProtocore is finalized, so that I can anchor the origin state root in the origin anchor (if any are present).

15. As a validator, I should be able to propose new metablock in the core contract on the origin chain.

16. As a validator, I should be able to register votes for the new metablock proposals in the core contract (taken from registered votes on Protocore; Ben: should we store these signatures or only which validators have voted?).

17. As a validator, I should be notified when the quorum is reached for a new metablock proposal (metablock is precommitted, store the committee formation height block number).

18. As a validator, I should be able to form a new committee, after the committee formation block height is reached.

19. As a validator, I should be notified when the status of committee changes.

20. As a validator, I should be able to calculate the correct members that should enter the committee.

21. As a validator, I should be able to enter a new committee.

22. As a validator, I should be able to add other validators in to a committee.

23. As a validator, I should be notified the validators that are added in to a committee. (so that I can track and challenge the committee if a validator has not entered)

24. As a validator, I should be notified when a new core is created. (so that I can create and store a genesis file)

25. As a validator, If I entered any committee then I should be able to start the auxiliary chain node for which the committee was formed, and subscribe to the the mosaic subgraph for this auxiliary chain.

26. As a validator, I should be able to challenge the committee if a validator has not entered the committee (during the committee cool down period).

27. As a validator and a member of a committee, I should be able to activate a committee.

28. As a validator and a member of a committee, I should be able to submit a sealed commit. (After verifying the auxiliary chain, till the direct (checkpoint) child of the target checkpoint of the vote message which precommitted the metablock.)

29. As a validator, I should be able to stop the auxiliary chain after the sealed commit was submitted.

30. As a validator and a member of a committee, I should be able to reveal my position by providing the salt that was used in the sealed commit.

31. As a validator I should be notified about the vote messages reported by other validators on the OriginProtocore, so that I can provide the signatures to slash the validator thats is violating the slashing conditions. (Post GEN1-BFT)

32. As a validator I should be notified about the vote messages reported by other validators on the SelfProtocore, so that I can provide the signatures to slash the validator thats is violating the slashing conditions. (Post GEN1-BFT)

33. As a validator, I should be able to logout.

34. As a validator, I should only _ever_ vote for links I have calculated myself.

35. As a validator, I should only EVER sign vote messages that do not violate slashing conditions with respect to the previously signed vote messages.

## Questions:

1. How will the validator executable start?
   - Validator can join any metachain by providing the following.
     - metachain id
     - Graph node endpoint.
   - Validator can start the executable without metachain id (interactive)
     - Graph node endpoint.
2. Should validators observe the new metachain chain creation event.

## meeting 4

Date: 14/1/2020

Note taker: Jayesh Bairagi

- When there's a precommit we should store the height. This way we will know the block number
- We can have a service/entity to check whatever changes we need at every block/at that particular stage
- Need to keep track of the cool down period to organize the validators that should enter the committee, during this period any one can start the challenge regarding to joining of any validator
- All the validators should keep track of all the other validators in the committee
- There can be pause once the validator start the process of starting the Aux chain as there will be processes like the syncing will be involved
- As a user anyone can challenge if a validator has not joined the committee
