## Overview

The Graph Service will be responsible to extract (event) data for the origin chain or a metachain into a PostgreSQL. The validator will be able to subscribe and make GraphQL queries to compose a local view of origin and a set of metachains, needed to operate.

`Mosaic-origin-subgraph` repository can contain the subgraph for the subgraph on Ethereum (mainnet) and Goerli (Hadapsar testnet).

`Mosaic-metachain-subgraph` repository can contain the (templated) subgraph for any metachain.
