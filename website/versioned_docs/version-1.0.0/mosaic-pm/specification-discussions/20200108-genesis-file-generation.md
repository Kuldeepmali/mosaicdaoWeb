## Overview

This will be an executable that will read the data from the core contract and generate the genesis file.

Tech governance can create a new metachain. This can be done by calling the `newMetachain` function on the `Axiom` contract on the origin chain. During this process, the contracts for the metachains i.e `Core`, `ConsensusGateway`, `Anchor` comes to existence on the origin chain but the auxiliary chain does not exist yet.

The auxiliary chain runs on clique to produce blocks for the network, so it critical to connect the peer validator nodes so that they can become the block producers and sign blocks on the same chain history, rather than producing blocks on independent forks.

To form this network following things are required

- A genesis file
- Boot nodes to discover the peers
- Initial sealer addresses in POA network.

In addition to this, the initial validators/sealers will need balance (gas) (utMOST) on the auxiliary chain to perform any transaction.

The validators can join the newly created core (`joinBeforeOpen`). Before joining the core, the validators must deposit `OST/MOST` on consensus gateway so that they can receive equivalent amount of `utMOST` on auxiliary chain.
When the minimum number of validators are joined then the block number (`rootOriginObservationBlockHeight`) is stored in the `Core` contract.

Now the genesis file can be created by the executable by reading the data from the contracts. The following params are written in the genesis file

- `config.chainId`
  This is the metachain id (core contract)
- `timestamp`
  This is the timestamp of of the Origin block at height `rootOriginObservationBlockHeight` (stored in core contract)
- `extraData`
  This will contain the address of all the validators that joined during the core.
- `alloc`
  This section of genesis file will contain the following
  - precompiled contracts
  - validators address with initial balance, the balance will be equal to the staked amount of OST/MOST.

The address `0x00..000000` is reserved for the `utMOST` contract.
The addresses from `0x00..004d00` to `0x00..004dff` are reserved for the precompiled mosaic contracts.

The precompiled contracts will be allocated at the following addresses

0x00..004dfe CoReputation [mastercopy]
0x00..004dff CoConsensus [mastercopy]
```

The storage of each contract will have some initial storage data. These initial data for the precompiled contracts will be written in the genesis file.

< Storage of each contract to be updated >
```

Once the genesis file is created, the validators can use it to start the chain.
The validators will publish the endpoint of bootnodes in the `Consensus` contract, so that other nodes can discover them as peers.

The template for genesis file is given below:

## User stories

- As a validator(user) I expect
  - I should be notified when the data for the genesis file creation is made available
  - The executable should already have and be able to query the following in the local database 
    - The metachain id using the core contract
    - The timestamp of the origin block using `rootOriginObservationBlockHeight`
    - The addresses of all other validators joining during the core creation
    - All the precompiled contracts
    - The initial balances or the staked amount(OST/MOST) of all the validators
  - The executable to generate the genesis once the minimum number of validators join the core contract.
  - The executable should have a template of genesis file that will be created with place holder that will be updated by the genesis file generation service.
    - The storage of each contract in the `alloc` section will have some initial storage data. These initial data for the precompiled contracts will be written in the genesis file.
  - The executable should utilize the above values and generate the genesis file such that
    - The metachain id will be assigned to the `config.chainId`
    - The timestamp will be assigned
    - The addresses of all the other validators to be stored in the `extraData` section
    - The precompiled contracts should be stored in the `alloc` section
    - The address of all the validators and their balances will be stored in the `alloc` section
    - The address`0x00..000000` will be reserved for the `utMOST` contract
    - The addresses from `0x00..004d00` to `0x00..004dff` are reserved for the precompiled mosaic contracts
 
## Assumptions

- The validator executable exists and is connected to rpc/ws endpoint
- The validator executable has already joined the core (`joinBeforeOpen`)
- The validator executable knows the consensus contract address.
- The validator executable knows the core contract address.

## Out of scope

## Open questions

1. Verify address 0x0 is not used by ethereum

## Approach

Ben: private key of validator with which it called `consensus:joinBeforeOpening` is shared with the keystore file the geth process needs to start as a "block producer"/"POA sealer". For Gen1-BFT
