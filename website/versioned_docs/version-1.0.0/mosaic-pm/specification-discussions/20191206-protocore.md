## Dual description between checkpoints and links

The objective of `Protocore` is to finalise a unique history of proposed blocks.

First we coarse-grain the history into a history of checkpoint blocks,
where for the consensus we only allow votes on blocks at
a block number which is an integer multiple of a `constant epochLength`.

However, if we implement a consensus logic with blocks or checkpoint blocks as fundamental objects, then the code will become complex.
We can delegate responsibility of ancestry checks to the layer-1 code to verify an unbroken chain of headers.

We can further construct a dual picture of `Link`s.

We do this in two steps. We define a `VoteMessage` as the known object

```js
<H(T(s)), s, t, h_s, h_t>
```

which is hashed to produce a `VoteMessageHash`; and a vote message where `h_t - h_s = epochLength`, can be proposed as a `Metablock` in `Core`.

Define now a `Link` as the object

```js
struct Link {
    bytes32 parentVoteMessageHash;
    bytes32 targetBlockHash;
    uint256 targetBlockNumber;
    bytes32 sourceTransitionHash;
    uint256 proposedMetablockHeight;
    uint256 forwardVoteCount;
    uint256 forwardVoteCountNextHeight;
    uint256 forwardVoteCountPreviousHeight;
    CheckpointFinalisationStatus targetFinalisation;
}
```

```js
enum CheckpointFinalisationStatus {
    Undefined,
    Registered,
    Justified,
    Finalised
}
```

## User Stories

- As a coconsensus contract I should be able to call `setup` function.
- As a user I should be able to propose a valid link.
- As an active validator I should be able to vote for the registered link.
- As a coconsensus contract I should be able to open a new metablock.

## Origin Protocore

`OriginProtocore` Casper FFG game differs from `SelfProtocore` one with absence
of the **inclusion principle**. There is no kernel and transition object for origin observations, so the VoteMessage should be simplified.

Metablock height of the `OriginProtocore` is the metablock height of the `SelfProtocore`. This determines the active validators that can justify and finalise the links (and associated checkpoints).

OriginProtocore reads validator set from SelfProtocore.

## Proposed interfaces

`Protocore` knows about `Link`s and `Validator`s who can vote on these links.
Links become supermajority links under certain conditions specified later.

```js
contract Protocore is MosaicVersion, ValidatorSet
{
    mapping(bytes32 /* vote message hash */ => Link) public links;

    /**
     * @notice openMetablock() function marks the specified metablock
     *         as opened.
     *
     * \pre `_metablockHeight` is plus one of the current metablock height of
     *      the protocore.
     * \pre `_kernelHash` is not 0.
     *
     * \post Increments open metablock height.
     * \post Updates stored kernel hash.
     */
    function openMetablock(
        uint256 _metablockHeight,
        bytes32 _kernelHash
    )
        external
    {
        // ...
    }

    /**
     * @notice _proposeLink() function proposes a valid link to be voted later
     *          by active validators.
     *
     * \pre `parentVoteMessageHash` is not 0.
     * \pre `parentVoteMessageHash` refers to an already proposed link which
     *      `targetFinalisation` is at least justified.
     * \pre `targetBlockHash` is not 0
     * \pre `targetBlockNumber` is a multiple of the epoch length.
     * \pre `targetBlockNumber` is bigger than a targetBlockNumber pointed
     *      by `_parentVoteMessageHash` link.
     * \pre A vote message hash (calculated with input params) does not exist.
     *
     * \post The link is saved in `links` mapping with currently
     *       open metablock height as `proposedMetablockHeight`.
     * \post `targetFinalisation` is set to 'Undefined'.
     * \post forwardVoteCount -s set to 0.

## Meeting 2

attendees: A G J D S P B
date 9/1/2020

Pro: base protocore for ProtocoreSelf and OriginObserver

Abhay:
- Does ProtoCore has state machine logic like Core state machine(Core status) on origin chain?

Sarvesh:- genesis link:
    1. There will be setup function which will initialize geneisis link. Some of the fields will be dummy values like (forward count and rear count will be zero.)

Task: Specification for defining metachain id, we need to define it for origin chain too.

Ben: Should the protocore (self) and origin protocore (origin observer) should inherit the validator set? or it can just reference to the coreputation contract to get the core validators ?

Deepesh: Will the protocores for other auxiliary chain will have the same validators sets that are for self protocore ?



## meeting 3
date: 13/1/2020

note taker: deepesh

- Pro runs over user stories, Ben scrolls the page
- Ben explained about forward and rear validator concept  on white board (check the video)
- Deepesh: Proposing a link and votion on the link should be different? or the proposal should also increase the vote count? 
    - It will be different, anyone can propose, the validators will vote.
- Deepesh: Is validatorSet a contract? Yes, its will be contract and core and protocore will inherit it.
